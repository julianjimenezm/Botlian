## Botlian, Another Discord Music Bot.

Botlian is a simple discord music bot, which mainly uses libraries such as Discord.py,youtubeDL,
ffmpeg, pynacl to get access to the musical repertoires of this web site.In our first attempt 
in the creation of this bot (bot_1.py), we used some predefined elements like the 
YTDLSource class where some configuration options are implemented by default. The most 
important result in our first attempt was satisfactory. We were able to play some music 
songs from youtube on the vocal channel of one of ours discord servers.

One of the disadvantages we had was that the songs had to be downloaded locally in order
to be played on our vocal channel, which caused delays in the programmed executions.

Looking to improve those inconvenients, we set out to implement a new bot that would allow 
us to import our music from a different source like "Spotify". Despite making satisfactory
progress with the Spotify API : renewing  authentication tokens and implementing some search
items requests,we couldn't properly connect our spotify account with our discord voice channel.
We tried to set up services likeLavalink but again we couldn’t configure it properly.

So to get out of this impasse, we decided to take a step back and try to improve what we had 
already achieved with our (bot_1). Where the lag between downloading time and reproduction,
that was our main issue.

So as a solution to this, we decided to find a way to implement the service provided by the youtubeDL
library. from downloading the files to executing a stream directly.  Once this task was accomplished,
we went from having a simple robot that would play music with delays,to streaming music along with 
functionalities and a more elaborate visual layout.(See README)

Then we finally got Botlian, our discord music bot.


enjoy it.
