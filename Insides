## Botlian, Another Discord Music Bot.

Botlian is a simple discord music bot, which mainly uses libraries such as youtubeDL, ffmpeg to get access to the musical 
repertoires of this website.In our first attempt in the creation of this bot (bot_1.py), we used some predefined elements like
the YTDLSource class where some configuration options are implemented by default. The most important result in our first attempt 
was satisfactory. We were able to playsome music songs from youtube on the vocal channel of one of ours discord servers.

One of the disadvantages we had was that the songs had to be downloaded locally in order to be played on our vocal channel,
which caused delays in the programmed executions.

Looking to improve those inconvenients, we set out to implement a new bot that would allow us to import our music from a different
source like "Spotify". Despite making satisfactory progress with the Spotify API : renewing  authentication tokens and implementing some
search items requests, we couldn't properly connect our spotify account with our discord voice channel. We tried to set up services like
Lavalink but again we couldnâ€™t configure it properly.

So to get out of this impasse, we decided to take a step back and try to improve what we had already achieved with our (bot_1). Where the 
lag between downloading time and reproduction, that was our main issue.

So as a solution to this, we decided to find a way to implement the service provided by the youtubeDL library. from downloading the files 
to executing a stream directly.  Once this task was accomplished, we went from having a simple robot that would play music with delays,
to streaming music along with functionalities (See README) and a more elaborate visual layout.

Then we finally got Botlian, our discord music bot.
