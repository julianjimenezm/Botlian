## Botlian.
###### Another discord Music BOT

The goal to implement this bot was to bring into practice some advanced programming concepts
such as OOP and asynchronous functions.

The result of the project is nothing more than the adaptation of certain theoretical concepts. 
So there is no claim of originality, it is just an exercise that allowed us to assimilate and 
implement some python concepts, in this case coroutines through music bot connections.


## Set-up.

- Setup properly your python ENV 

- To run this bot you can directly clone this repository and import our requirements.txt

>in your console:
>
>$ git clone https://github.com/julianjimenezm/Botlian.git
>
>$ pip install -r requirements.txt

- Dont forget use your own discord token into your code.

- if you want to access to our server use: https://discord.gg/k2fMPJHC and ask for the current token.
